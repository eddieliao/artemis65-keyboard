# Artemis65 Keyboard
PCB and Plate Files for Artemis65 Keyboard

To create your own, order a PCB from your manufacturer of choice (I used www.jlcpcb.com) using the `gerbers.zip` file in `gerbers`. 

Likewise, plates can be laser cut or milled using the `Switch Plate.svg` file. If one wants an FR4 switch plate, use the `artemis65-plate.zip` in `Plate/Switch Plate/gerbers/` to order an FR4 plate from your preferred PCB manufacturer.

The case can be either 3D printed or milled from aluminum/your metal of choice. A CAD model of the file is provided (`Artemis65 Case.3mf`)
